@article{Dooley:13,
	Abstract = {We describe the angular sensing and control (ASC) of 4\&\#xA0;km detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Enhanced LIGO, the culmination of the first generation LIGO detectors, operated between 2009 and 2010 with about 40\&\#xA0;kW of laser power in the arm cavities. In this regime, radiation-pressure effects are significant and induce instabilities in the angular opto-mechanical transfer functions. Here we present and motivate the ASC design in this extreme case and present the results of its implementation in Enhanced LIGO. Highlights of the ASC performance are successful control of opto-mechanical torsional modes, relative mirror motions of \&\#x2264;\&\#x2009;1\&\#xD7;10\&\#x2212;7\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;rad rms, and limited impact on in-band strain sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {Advancing technology will soon make possible a new class of gravitation experiments: pure laboratory experiments with laboratory sources of {non-Newtonian} gravity and laboratory detectors. This paper proposes seven such experiments; and for each one it describes; briefly; the dominant sources of noise and the technology required. Three experiments would utilize a high- Q  torque balance as the detector. They include (i) an "Amp\`{e}re-type" experiment to measure the gravitational spin-spin coupling of two rotating bodies; (ii) a search for time changes of the gravitation constant; and (iii) a measurement of the gravity produced by magnetic stresses and energy. Three experiments would utilize a high- Q  dielectric crystal as the detector. They include (i) a "Faraday-type" experiment to measure the "electric-type" gravity produced by a time-changing flux of "magnetic-type" gravity; (ii) a search for "preferred-frame" and "preferred-orientation" effects in gravitational coupling; and (iii) a measurement of the gravitational field produced by protons moving in a storage ring at nearly the speed of light. One experiment would use a high- Q  toroidal microwave cavity as detector to search for the dragging of inertial frames by a rotating body.},

@article{Accadia:2011ge,
	Abstract = {The Virgo gravitational wave detector is an interferometer (ITF) with 3 km arms located in Pisa, Italy. From July to October 2010, Virgo performed its third science run (VSR3) in coincidence with the LIGO detectors. Despite several techniques adopted to isolate the ITF from the environment, seismic noise remains an important issue for Virgo. Vibrations produced by the detector infrastructure (such as air conditioning units, water chillers/heaters, pumps) are found to affect Virgo's sensitivity, with the main coupling mechanisms being through beam jitter and scattered light processes. The Advanced Virgo design seeks to reduce ITF couplings to environmental noise by having most vibration-sensitive components suspended and in vacuum, as well as muffle and relocate loud machines. During the months of June and July in 2010, a G{\"u}ralp-3TD seismometer was stationed at various locations around the Virgo site hosting major infrastructure machines. Seismic data were examined using spectral and coherence analysis with seismic probes close to the detector. The primary aim of this study was to identify noisy machines which seismically affect the ITF environment and thus require mitigation attention. Analyzed machines are located at various distances from the experimental halls, ranging from 10 to 100 m. An attempt is made to measure the attenuation of emitted noise at the ITF and correlate it with the distance from the source and with seismic attenuation models in soil.},

	Abstract = {Diffraction gratings have been proposed as core optical elements in future laser interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper, we derive equations for the coupling between alignment noise and phase noise at diffraction gratings. In comparison to a standard reflective component (mirror or beam splitter) the diffractive nature of the gratings causes an additional coupling of geometry changes into alignment and phase noise. Expressions for the change in angle and optical path length of each outgoing beam are provided as functions of a translation or rotation of the incoming beam with respect to the grating. The analysis is based entirely on the grating equation and the geometry of the set-up. We further analyse exemplary optical set-ups which have been proposed for the use in future gravitational-wave detectors. We find that the use of diffraction gratings yields a strong coupling of alignment noise into phase noise. By comparing the results with the specifications of current detectors, we show that this additional noise coupling results in new, challenging requirements for the suspension and isolation systems for optical components.},

This method is based on heterodyne detection of cylindrical transverse cavity modes. A specially designed annular-segmented photodiode is used to measure the amplitude of nonresonant modes reflected by the cavity. Our measurements allow us to optimize cavity mode matching to nearly 99.98\% and will play an important diagnostic role in gravitational-wave detectors.},

	Abstract = {Interferometric gravitational wave detectors are designed to detect small perturbations in the relative lengths of their kilometer-scale arms that are induced by passing gravitational radiation. An analysis of the effects of imperfect optical alignment on the strain sensitivity of such an interferometer shows that to achieve maximum strain sensitivity at the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory requires that the angular orientations of the optics be within 10−8 rad rms of the optical axis, and the beam must be kept centered on the mirrors within 1 mm. In addition, fluctuations in the input laser beam direction must be less than 1.5 × 10−14 {rad/√Hz} in angle and less than 2.8 × 10−10 {m/√Hz} in transverse displacement for frequencies f > 150 Hz in order that they not produce spurious noise in the gravitational wave readout channel. We show that seismic disturbances limit the use of local reference frames for angular alignment at a level approximately an order of magnitude worse than required. A wave-front sensing scheme that uses the input laser beam as the reference axis is presented that successfully discriminates among all angular degrees of freedom and permits the implementation of a closed-loop servo control to suppress the environmentally driven angular fluctuations sufficiently.},

	Abstract = {We review key experimental and theoretical results on the Barkhausen effect,
focusing on the statistical analysis of the noise. We discuss the experimental
methods and the material used and review recent measurements. The picture
emerging from the experimental data is that Barkhausen avalanche distributions
and power spectra can be described by scaling laws as in critical phenomena. In
addition, there is growing evidence that soft ferromagnetic bulk materials can
be grouped in different classes according to the exponent values. Soft thin
films still remain to be fully explored both experimentally and theoretically.
Reviewing theories and models proposed in the recent past to account for the
scaling properties of the Barkhausen noise, we conclude that the domain wall
depinning scenario successfully explains most experimental data. Finally, we
report a translation from German of the original paper by H. Barkhausen.},

@article{PF:RPP2009,
	Abstract = {The goal of the Laser Interferometric {Gravitational-Wave} Observatory ({LIGO}) is to detect and study gravitational waves ({GWs}) of astrophysical origin. Direct detection of {GWs} holds the promise of testing general relativity in the strong-field regime, of providing a new probe of exotic objects such as black holes and neutron stars and of uncovering unanticipated new astrophysics. {LIGO}, a joint {Caltech--MIT} project supported by the National Science Foundation, operates three multi-kilometer interferometers at two widely separated sites in the United States. These detectors are the result of decades of worldwide technology development, design, construction and commissioning. They are now operating at their design sensitivity, and are sensitive to gravitational wave strains smaller than one part in 10 21 . With this unprecedented sensitivity, the data are being analyzed to detect or place limits on {GWs} from a variety of potential astrophysical sources.},

@article{Kroker:11,
	Abstract = {We report on a novel concept for reflective diffractive cavity couplers based on resonant waveguide gratings instead of multilayer coatings. The diffracting or rather beam splitting properties are induced to the subwavelength structures by a periodic parameter modulation of the ridges. Since such a perturbation of the highly reflective system also enhances transmission stacks of two and three reflectors are considered to retrieve transmittivities as low as possible. Our calculations show that transmissions of less than 10{\textminus}4 are possible for different configurations based on silicon and silica. The results of first technological tests for the realization of stacked T-shape structures are presented. With a total effective layer thickness not exceeding 1.1 $\mu$m the discussed approaches are expected to remarkably reduce the urgent problem of coating thermal noise of conventional components for high-precision metrology.},

	Abstract = {For the interferometric detection of extremely small displacements one of the principal limiting factors can be scattered light, having a certain path difference against the main beam, in combination with the inevitable frequency fluctuations of the light source. This paper presents a method to suppress the effect originating from the co-operation of these two deficiencies. The idea is to blot out the scattered light effect by deliberately phase-modulating the light with appropriate frequency and phase swing. A theoretical treatment is given for the principles of this novel method. The paper discusses possible sources of scattered light in a gravitational wave detector and the application of the method to blot out the effect caused by the scattered light. It furthermore describes a method to measure the different contributions of scattered light and presents first experimental results for their suppression. Suggestions and calculations for further improvements are given.},

	Abstract = {We describe the design of the suspension systems for the major optics for Advanced LIGO, the upgrade to LIGO---the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory. The design is based on that used in GEO600---the German/UK interferometric gravitational wave detector, with further development to meet the more stringent noise requirements for Advanced LIGO. The test mass suspensions consist of a four-stage or quadruple pendulum for enhanced seismic isolation. To minimize suspension thermal noise, the final stage consists of a silica mirror, 40 kg in mass, suspended from another silica mass by four silica fibres welded to silica ears attached to the sides of the masses using hydroxide-catalysis bonding. The design is chosen to achieve a displacement noise level for each of the seismic and thermal noise contributions of 10 −19 m/√Hz at 10 Hz, for each test mass. We discuss features of the design which has been developed as a result of experience with prototypes and associated investigations.},

	Abstract = {In-vacuum Faraday isolators ({FIs}) are used in gravitational wave interferometers to prevent the disturbance caused by light reflected back to the input port from the interferometer itself. The efficiency of the optical isolation is becoming more critical with the increase of laser input power. An in-vacuum {FI}, used in a gravitational wave experiment (Virgo), has a 20mm clear aperture and is illuminated by an almost {20W} incoming beam, having a diameter of about 5mm. When going in vacuum at 10−6mbar, a degradation of the isolation exceeding {10dB} was observed. A remotely controlled system using a motorized λ/2 waveplate inserted between the first polarizer and the Faraday rotator has proven its capability to restore the optical isolation to a value close to the one set up in air.},

	Abstract = {We describe a model evaluating changes in the optical isolation of a Faraday            isolator when passing from air to vacuum in terms of different thermal effects in the            crystal. The changes are particularly significant in the crystal thermal lensing            (refraction index and thermal expansion) and in its Verdet constant and can be ascribed            to the less efficient convection cooling of the magneto-optic crystal of the Faraday            isolator. An isolation decrease by a factor of 10 is experimentally observed in a            Faraday isolator that is used in a gravitational wave experiment (Virgo) with a 10 W            input laser when going from air to vacuum. A finite element model simulation reproduces            with a great accuracy the experimental data measured on Virgo and on a test bench. A            first set of measurements of the thermal lensing has been used to characterize the            losses of the crystal, which depend on the sample. The isolation factor measured on            Virgo confirms the simulation model and the absorption losses of 0.0016 {\textpm} 0.0002/cm for            the TGG magneto-optic crystal used in the Faraday isolator.},

	Abstract = {A prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity, 
gravitational waves ({GWs}) are perturbations of the flat space-time 
Minkowski metric that travel at the speed of light. Indirectly 
measured by Hulse and Taylor in the 1970s through the energy they 
carried away from a binary pulsar system, gravitational waves have 
yet to be detected directly. The Laser Interferometer 
Gravitational-wave Observatory ({LIGO}) is part of a global network of 
gravitational-wave detectors that seeks to detect directly 
gravitational waves and to study their sources. 

{LIGO} operates on the principle of measuring the gravitational wave's 
physical signature of a strain, or relative displacement of inertial 
masses. An extremely small effect whose biggest of expected 
transient signals on Earth is on the order of one part in 10^23, 
gravitational-wave strain can only be measured by detectors so 
sensitive to displacement as to encounter the effects of quantum 
physics. To improve their sensitivities and to demonstrate advanced 
technologies, the {LIGO} observatories in Hanford, {WA} and Livingston, 
{LA} underwent an upgrade between fall 2007 and summer 2009 called 
Enhanced {LIGO}. This study focuses on the experimental challenges of 
one of the goals of the upgrade: operating at an increased laser 
power. 

I present the design and characterization of two of the 
interferometer subsystems that are critical for the path towards 
higher laser power: the Input Optics ({IO}) and the Angular Sensing 
and Control ({ASC}) subsystems. The {IO} required a new design so its 
optical components would not be susceptible to high power effects 
such as thermal lensing or thermal beam drift. The {ASC} required a 
new design in order to address static instabilities of the arm 
cavities caused by increased radiation pressure. In all, I 
demonstrate the capability of an interferometric {GW} detector to 
operate at several times the highest of laser powers previously 
used.},

@article{aLIGO:ASC,
	Abstract = {The advanced LIGO detectors are currently in their final design stage, and the installation phase will start at the end of 2010: they will have about 10 times better sensitivity than initial LIGO, with a sensitive band ranging from 10 Hz to 10 kHz. As compared with previous LIGO detectors, there will be increased complexity in the optical configuration, improved seismic isolation system and significantly higher power circulating in the arm cavities. In the new detectors, the control of the angular orientation of the mirrors will be particularly challenging. The advanced LIGO (aLIGO) mirrors need to have a residual angular motion of the order of 1 nrad RMS in order to achieve high sensitivity. In the high power regime, the torque induced by radiation pressure effects will be comparable with the restoring torque of the mirror suspension, such that we must think of the opto-mechanical response, instead of just the mechanical response. These modifications have to be considered in order to design the control strategy for keeping the mirrors well aligned. Moreover, to meet the sensitivity target the alignment control noise coupled to the gravitational-wave channel must be well below ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0264-9381/27/8/084026/cqg338035ieqn1.gif] {6\times 10^{-18}\; \hbox{m}/{\hbox{$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$}}} at 10 Hz. We developed a model of the alignment sensing and control scheme of aLIGO which takes into account radiation pressure effects and meets the noise target.},

	Abstract = {Interferometric gravitational-wave antennas are based on Michelson interferometers whose sensitivity to small differential length changes has been enhanced by the addition of multiple coupled optical resonators. The use of optical cavities is essential for reaching the required sensitivity but sets challenges for the control system, which must maintain the cavities near resonance. The goal for the strain sensitivity of the Laser Interferometer {Gravitational-Wave} Observatory ({LIGO}) is 10−21 rms, integrated over a {100-Hz} bandwidth centered at 150 Hz. We present the major design features of the {LIGO} length and frequency sensing and control system, which will hold the differential length to within 5 × 10−14 m of the operating point. We also highlight the restrictions imposed by couplings of noise into the gravitational-wave readout signal and the required immunity against them.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the electromagnetic fields in a {Pound-Drever}-Hall locked, marginally unstable, {Fabry-Perot} cavity as a function of small changes in the cavity length during resonance. More specifically, we compare the results of a detailed numerical model with the behavior of the recycling cavity of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory ({LIGO}) detector located in Livingston, Louisiana. In the interferometer's normal mode of operation, the recycling cavity is stabilized by inducing a thermal lens in the cavity mirrors with an external {CO2} laser. During our study, this thermal compensation system was not operating, causing the cavity to be marginally optically unstable and cavity modes to become degenerate. In contrast to stable optical cavities, the modal content of the resonating beam in the uncompensated recycling cavity is significantly altered by very small cavity length changes. This modifies the error signals used to control the cavity length in such a way that the zero crossing point is no longer the point of maximum power in the cavity, nor is it the point where the input-beam mode in the cavity is maximized.},

@article{Nic:2011,
	Abstract = {Critically coupled resonant optical cavities are often used as mode cleaners in optical systems to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a signal that is encoded as an amplitude modulation of a laser beam. Achieving the best SNR requires maintaining the alignment of the mode cleaner relative to the laser beam on which the signal is encoded. An automatic alignment system that is primarily sensitive to the carrier field component of the beam will not, in general, provide optimal SNR. We present an approach that modifies traditional dither alignment sensing by applying a large amplitude modulation on the signal field, thereby producing error signals that are sensitive to the signal sideband field alignment. When used in conjunction with alignment actuators, this approach can improve the detected SNR; we demonstrate a factor of 3 improvement in the SNR of a kilometer-scale detector of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. This approach can be generalized to other types of alignment sensors.},

@article{ninja2,
	Abstract = {The numerical injection analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effort between members of the numerical-relativity and gravitational wave data-analysis communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the sensitivity of existing gravitational-wave search and parameter-estimation algorithms using numerically generated waveforms and to foster closer collaboration between the numerical-relativity and data-analysis communities. The first NINJA project used only a small number of injections of short numerical-relativity waveforms, which limited its ability to draw quantitative conclusions. The goal of the NINJA-2 project is to overcome these limitations with long post-Newtonian---numerical-relativity hybrid waveforms, large numbers of injections and the use of real detector data. We report on the submission requirements for the NINJA-2 project and the construction of the waveform catalog. Eight numerical-relativity groups have contributed 56 hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modeling the late inspiral, merger and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modeling the early inspiral. We summarize the techniques used by each group in constructing their submissions. We also report on the procedures used to validate these submissions, including examination in the time and frequency domains and comparisons of waveforms from different groups against each other. These procedures have so far considered only the (ℓ, m ) = (2, 2) mode. Based on these studies, we judge that the hybrid waveforms are suitable for NINJA-2 studies. We note some of the plans for these investigations.},

	Abstract = {We compute the quadrupole mode of the gravitational waveform of inspiralling compact binaries at the third and half-post-Newtonian (3.5PN) approximation of general relativity. The computation is performed using the multipolar post-Newtonian formalism, and restricted to binaries without spins moving on quasi-circular orbits. The new inputs mainly include the 3.5PN terms in the mass quadrupole moment of the source, and the control of required subdominant corrections to the contributions of hereditary integrals (tails and nonlinear memory effect). The result is given in the form of the quadrupolar mode (2, 2) in a spin-weighted spherical harmonic decomposition of the waveform, and may be used for comparison with the counterpart quantity computed in numerical relativity. It is a step towards the computation of the full 3.5PN waveform, whose knowledge is expected to reduce the errors on the location parameters of the source.},

	Abstract = {Second generation gravitational wave detectors are being installed in a number of locations globally. These long-baseline, Michelson interferometers increase the sensitivity between 10 and 40 Hz by many orders of magnitude compared with first generation instruments. Control of non-linear noise coupling from scattered light fields is critical to achieve low frequency performance. In this paper we investigate the requirements on the attenuation of scattered light using a novel time-domain analysis and two years of seismic data from the LIGO Livingston Observatory.},

	Abstract = {Using a network of seismometers and sets of optimal filters, we implemented a feed-forward control technique to minimize the seismic contribution to multiple interferometric degrees of freedom of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory interferometers. The filters are constructed by using the Levinson--Durbin recursion relation to approximate the optimal Wiener filter. By reducing the RMS of the interferometer feedback signals below ∼10 Hz, we have improved the stability and duty cycle of the joint network of gravitational wave detectors. By suppressing the large control forces and mirror motions, we have dramatically reduced the rate of non-Gaussian transients in the gravitational wave signal stream.},

@article{LSC:rates,
	Abstract = {We present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all types of compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial and advanced versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors LIGO and Virgo. Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters and are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 Myr −1 per Milky Way Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 Myr −1 MWEG −1 to 1000 Myr −1 MWEG −1 (Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 601 L179; Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 614 L137 (erratum)). We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected sensitivities for our advanced detectors. Using the detector sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGO--Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between 2 × 10 −4 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron--star detection rate for the Advanced LIGO--Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between 0.4 and 400 per year.},

	Abstract = {In this Letter I compare recent findings suggesting a low binary star fraction for late-type stars with knowledge concerning the forms of the stellar initial and present-day mass functions for masses down to the hydrogen-burning limit. This comparison indicates that most stellar systems formed in the Galaxy are likely single and not binary, as has been often asserted. Indeed, in the current epoch two-thirds of all main-sequence stellar systems in the Galactic disk are composed of single stars. Some implications of this realization for understanding the star and planet formation process are briefly mentioned.},

One of the most significant limits to the sensitivity of current, and future, long-baseline interferometric gravitational wave detectors is thermal displacement noise of the test masses and their suspensions. Detector suspension thermal noise will be an important noise source at operating frequencies between approximately 10 and 30 Hz, and results from a combination of thermoelastic damping, surface and bulk losses associated with the suspension fibres. However its effects can be reduced by minimizing the thermoelastic loss and optimization of pendulum dilution factor via appropriate choice of suspension fibre and attachment geometry.

	Abstract = {The power spectral density of surface-relief variations on polished optical surfaces across microscopic through to macroscopic spatial scales is calculated from measurements on substrates that are being produced for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). These spectra give a guide to the scattering properties of the surface, which in turn critically influence the performance of LIGO. Measurements obtained by use of a full-aperture interferometer and an interference microscope with two different objectives are combined to produce one-dimensional power spectral density representations of the surfaces across spatial frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 8000 cm{\textminus}1. These measurements from different instruments are in good agreement with an analytic power spectrum that varies as $\nu${\textminus}1.5, where $\nu$ is the spatial frequency. Some anomalies in the power spectral density spectra can be related to aspects of the polishing process.},

@article{Ott:SN2009,
	Abstract = {We review the ensemble of anticipated gravitational-wave (GW) emission processes in stellar core collapse and postbounce core-collapse supernova evolution. We discuss recent progress in the modeling of these processes and summarize most recent GW signal estimates. In addition, we present new results on the GW emission from postbounce convective overturn and protoneutron star g -mode pulsations based on axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic calculations. Galactic core-collapse supernovae are very rare events, but within 3--5 Mpc from Earth, the rate jumps to 1 in ~2 years. Using the set of currently available theoretical gravitational waveforms, we compute upper-limit optimal signal-to-noise ratios based on current and advanced LIGO/GEO600/VIRGO noise curves for the recent SN 2008bk which exploded at ~3.9 Mpc. While initial LIGOs cannot detect GWs emitted by core-collapse events at such a distance, we find that advanced LIGO-class detectors could put significant upper limits on the GW emission strength for such events. We study the potential occurrence of the various GW emission processes in particular supernova explosion scenarios and argue that the GW signatures of neutrino-driven, magneto-rotational, and acoustically-driven core-collapse SNe may be mutually exclusive. We suggest that even initial LIGOs could distinguish these explosion mechanisms based on the detection (or non-detection) of GWs from a galactic core-collapse supernova.},

	Abstract = {Parametric instabilities have been predicted to occur in all advanced high optical power gravitational wave detectors. In this paper we review the problem of parametric instabilities, summarize the latest findings and assess various schemes proposed for their control. We show that non-resonant passive damping of test masses reduces parametric instability but has a noise penalty, and fails to suppress the Q -factor of many modes. Resonant passive damping is shown to have significant advantages but requires detailed modeling. An optical feedback mode suppression interferometer is proposed which is capable of suppressing all instabilities but requires experimental development.},

@article{Gras:PI2009,
	Abstract = {The next generation of laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors requires optical cavities with stored power approaching 1 MW. However, such proposed cavities are subject to parametric instability where carrier power resonantly downconverts to drive a large number of test mass acoustic resonances. Damping rings on the test mass circumference have been proposed as a means of suppressing such instabilities, and in previous work, the affect of such a ring on test mass acoustic modes and thermal noise was analysed. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the general issue of parametric instability suppression with damping rings. We determine the optimal position and geometry of damping rings, so as to obtain sufficient instability suppression with the least thermal noise penalty. It is shown that unilateral stability can be attained with a ring damper alone at the expense of a 20% increase in thermal noise, while if just one optical mode is suppressed, there is only a 5% noise penalty.},

	Abstract = {The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are next generation instruments which will replace the existing initial LIGO detectors. They are currently being constructed and installed. Advanced LIGO strain sensitivity is designed to be about a factor 10 better than initial LIGO over a broad band and usable to 10 Hz, in contrast to 40 Hz for initial LIGO. This is expected to allow for detections and significant astrophysics in most categories of gravitational waves. To achieve this sensitivity, all hardware subsystems are being replaced with improvements. Designs and expected performance are presented for the seismic isolation, suspensions, optics and laser subsystems. Possible enhancements to Advanced LIGO, either to resolve problems that may arise and/or to allow for improved performance, are now being researched. Some of these enhancements are discussed along with some potential technology being considered for detectors beyond Advanced LIGO.},

Such cavities suppress the build-up of high order modes of the resonating sidebands, with some advantage for the commissioning of the detector and the build-up of the gravitational signal. Here we present the baseline design of the Advanced Virgo non-degenerate recycling cavities, giving some preliminay results of simulations about the tolerances of this design to astigmatism, mirror figure errors and thermal lensing.},

	Abstract = {Thermal effects are already important in currently operating interferometric gravitational wave detectors. Planned upgrades of these detectors involve increasing optical power to combat quantum shot noise. We consider the ramifications of this increased power for one particular class of laser beams---wide, flat-topped, mesa beams. In particular we model a single mesa beam Fabry--Perot cavity having thermoelastically deformed mirrors. We calculate the intensity profile of the fundamental cavity eigenmode in the presence of thermal perturbations, and the associated changes in thermal noise. We also outline an idealized method of correcting for such effects. At each stage we contrast our results with those of a comparable Gaussian beam cavity. Although we focus on mesa beams the techniques described are applicable to any azimuthally symmetric system.},

Remarkably, they all rotate in a narrow range of frequencies (no more than a factor of 2, with many within 20% of 300 Hz). I suggest that these stars rotate fast enough so that, on average, the angular momentum added by accretion is lost to gravitational radiation. The strong ν s -dependence of the angular momentum loss rate from gravitational radiation then provides a natural reason for similar spin frequencies. Provided that the interior temperature has a large-scale asymmetry misaligned from the spin axis, then the temperature-sensitive electron captures in the deep crust can provide the quadrupole needed ( ~10 −7 MR 2 ) to reach this limiting situation at ν s ≈ 300 Hz. This quadrupole is only present during accretion and makes it difficult to form radio pulsars with ν s > (600-800) Hz by accreting at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/dotM.gif] {dot M} ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 10 −10 M ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-4357/501/1/L89/img3.gif] {_{{\odot}}} yr −1 . The gravity wave strength is h c ~(0.5-1) × 10 −26 from many of these neutron stars and greater than 2 × 10 −26 for Sco X-1. Prior knowledge of the position, spin frequency, and orbital periods will allow for deep searches for these periodic signals with gravitational wave interferometers (LIGO, VIRGO, and the "dual-recycled" GEO 600 detector), and experimenters need to take such sources into account. Sco X-1 will most likely be detected first.},

The space project LISA shares its goal and principle of operation with the ground-based interferometers currently under construction: the detection and measurement of gravitational waves by laser interferometry. Only in space, detection of signals below, say, 1 Hz is possible. LISA, a joint project of ESA and NASA, is a mission that will measure these low-frequency waves. LISA consists of three spacecraft in heliocentric orbits, forming a triangle with 5 million km sides. Launch for LISA is scheduled for 2011, following a technology demonstrator LTP in 2006.},

This is the first measurement of this effect in a complete gravitational-wave interferometer. Only one of the two angular modes survives with feedback control, because the other mode is suppressed when the control gain is sufficiently large. We developed a mathematical model to understand the physics of the system. This model matches well with the dynamics that we observe.},

A1064 nm wavelength nonplanar ring oscillator (NPRO) laser stabilizedto a resonant transition in molecular iodine is suitable for these missions,providing high-frequency stability at an absolute reference frequency. Theiodine stabilized laser also offers low sensitivity to temperature and alignmentfluctuations and allows frequency tuning. We have evaluated the noiseperformance of a NPRO laser stabilized to iodine using frequency modulationspectroscopy and have found an Allan standard deviation of10{\textminus}14 over 100 s.Simplified optical configurations and the radiation hardness of the frequency-doublingcrystals have also been investigated.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate a method to measure and actively reduce the coupling of vibrations            to the phase noise of a cavity-stabilized laser. This method uses the vibration noise of            the laboratory environment rather than active drive to perturb the optical cavity. The            laser phase noise is measured via a beat note with a second unperturbed ultra-stable            laser while the vibrations are measured by accelerometers positioned around the cavity.            A Wiener filter algorithm extracts the frequency and direction dependence of the cavity            response function. Once the cavity response function is known, real-time noise            cancellation can be implemented by use of the accelerometer measurements to predict and            then cancel the laser phase fluctuations. We present real-time noise cancellation that            results in a 25 dB reduction of the laser phase noise power spectral density.},

Interferometers that employ optical delay lines are particularly susceptible to noise from scattered light. The authors present a method of suppressing such noise signals by using fast phase modulation of the laser light. It is shown that all scattered all contributions from the delay line may be cancelled, up to arbitrarily long path differences. This can be achieved with an appropriately structured square-wave modulation function which switches the phase of the light by pi .},

	Abstract = {In April of 2009 a seismic survey utilizing explosive charges took place in Livingston parish, Louisiana. The area of the survey encompassed the location of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Livingston interferometer. In this paper, we present an analysis of seismic data recorded with three of the LIGO seismometers and a geophone array that was deployed during the time of the survey. In particular, the geophone-array data are used to study the propagation of surface waves, whereas first-arrival measurements with the LIGO seismometers provide estimates of the speed of compressional seismic waves as a function of depth. We find that fundamental Rayleigh waves have a speed close to 205 m/s consistent with results from previous borehole tests and that speed of compressional waves is 1650 m/s at 25 m depth, increasing to 2300 m/s at 1 km depth. Blast spectra are further investigated to determine the Q value of the ground medium experienced by Rayleigh waves (f>1 Hz) and body waves deeper underground. The estimated Q value is approximately 50 for the surface waves and exceeds a value of 190 for body waves propagating at depths below 100 m.},

	Abstract = {The TAMA SAS seismic attenuation system was developed to provide the extremely high level of seismic isolation required by the next generation of interferometric gravitational wave detectors to achieve the desired sensitivity at low frequencies. Our aim was to provide good performance at frequencies above ~10 Hz, while utilizing only passive subsystems in the sensitive frequency band of the TAMA interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The only active feedback is relegated below 6 Hz and it is used to damp the rigid body resonances of the attenuation chain. Simulations, based on subsystem performance characterizations, indicate that the system can achieve rms mirror residual motion measured in a few tens of nanometres. We will give a brief overview of the subsystems and point out some of the characterization results, supporting our claims of achieved performance. SAS is a passive, UHV compatible and low cost system. It is likely that extremely sensitive experiments in other fields will also profit from our study.},

@article{Cre2008,
	Abstract = {The relative positions of the test masses in gravitational-wave detectors will be influenced not only by astrophysical gravitational waves, but also by the fluctuating Newtonian gravitational forces of moving masses in the ground and air around the detector. These effects are often referred to as gravity gradient noise. This paper considers the effects of gravity gradients from density perturbations in the atmosphere, and from massive airborne objects near the detector. These have been discussed previously by Saulson (1984 Phys. Rev. D 30 732), who considered the effects of background acoustic pressure waves and of massive objects moving smoothly past the interferometer; the gravity gradients he predicted would be too small to be of serious concern even for advanced interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. In this paper, I revisit these phenomena, considering transient atmospheric shocks, and estimating the effects of sound waves or objects colliding with the ground or buildings around the test masses. I also consider another source of atmospheric density fluctuations: temperature perturbations that are advected past the detector by the wind. I find that background acoustic noise and temperature fluctuations still produce gravity gradient noise that is below the noise floor even of advanced interferometric detectors, although temperature perturbations carried along non-laminar streamlines could produce noise that is within an order of magnitude of the projected noise floor at 10 Hz. A definitive study of this effect may require better models of the wind flow past a given instrument. I also find that transient shockwaves in the atmosphere could potentially produce large spurious signals, with signal-to-noise ratios in the hundreds in an advanced interferometric detector. These signals could be vetoed by means of acoustic sensors outside of the buildings. Massive wind-borne objects such as tumbleweeds could also produce gravity gradient signals with signal-to-noise ratios in the hundreds if they collide with the interferometer buildings, so it may be necessary to build fences preventing such objects from approaching within about 30 m of the test masses.},

LIGO will support studies concerning the nature and nonlinear dynamics of gravity, the structures of black holes, and the equation of state of nuclear matter. It will also measure the masses, birth rates, collisions, and distributions of black holes and neutron stars in the universe and probe the cores of supernovae and the very early universe. The technology for LIGO has been developed during the past 20 years. Construction will begin in 1992, and under the present schedule, LIGO's gravitational-wave searches will begin in 1998.},

@article{Hartmut:2010,
	Abstract = {The British--German gravitational wave detector GEO 600 has concluded a long observational period called Astrowatch , which lasted from November 2007 to July 2009. Together with the LIGO-H2 detector, GEO 600 was kept observing, while other detectors of the world-wide network of laser-interferometers like LIGO(L1 and H1) and Virgo were upgraded. A fraction of the time during the astrowatch period was set apart for noise investigations and experiments preparing future upgrades. Even with these investigations GEO 600 reached an observation time of 86.0% of the overall time, such that a total of 522 days worth of data were collected. The average sensitivity was roughly a factor of 2 lower than that of the LIGO-H2 detector for frequencies above 500 Hz. In July 2009 GEO 600 has started an upgrade program called GEO-HF . Within this program we aim at improving the sensitivity by a number of sequential upgrades, like tuned signal recycling, DC readout, output mode-cleaning, injection of squeezed vacuum states and the increase of circulating light power. Tuned signal recycling and DC readout have already been implemented and can be operated robustly, due to a new technique associated with the automatic alignment system.},

	Abstract = {The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) operates a 40m prototype interferometer on the Caltech campus. The primary mission of the prototype is to serve as an experimental testbed for upgrades to the LIGO interferometers and for gaining experience with advanced interferometric techniques, including detuned resonant sideband extraction (i.e. signal recycling) and dc readout (optical homodyne detection). The former technique will be employed in Advanced LIGO, and the latter in both Enhanced and Advanced LIGO. Using dc readout for gravitational wave signal extraction has several technical advantages, including reduced laser and oscillator noise couplings as well as reduced shot noise, when compared to the traditional rf readout technique (optical heterodyne detection) currently in use in large-scale ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors. The Caltech 40m laboratory is currently prototyping a dc readout system for a fully suspended interferometric gravitational wave detector. The system includes an optical filter cavity at the interferometer's output port, and the associated controls and optics to ensure that the filter cavity is optimally coupled to the interferometer. We present the results of measurements to characterize noise couplings in rf and dc readout using this system.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational wave detectors have been under development since the pioneering work of Weber in the 1960s. The long and painstaking research effort has yielded enormous improvements in detector sensitivity. Astronomical observations of binary pulsar systems have confirmed the existence of gravitational radiation. Direct detection is inevitable once planned detectors reach sensitivity goals. This review begins by introducing the concept of gravitational waves, and discusses their significance. Section 2 discusses sources of gravitational waves, giving estimates of signal characteristics and signal strengths. Section 3 presents an overview of gravitational wave detection and the critical issues of data processing. In the fourth section the physics of resonant-mass gravitational wave detectors is discussed in some detail, covering all areas from antenna materials to transducers and the quantum limits to measurement. This section reviews the major operating antennas in the existing worldwide array but also discusses the prospects for achieving substantial increases in sensitivity in the future. The fifth section presents the concepts and designs for laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors. Large-scale devices will be in operation in the first decade of the twenty-first century and should eventually be certain of detecting a known class of gravitational wave source. At their predicted sensitivity, space interferometers will be able to detect numerous known galactic sources of gravitational waves and also will be able to detect black hole mergers that are thought to have occurred as primordial galaxies merged and grew in the early universe.},

	Abstract = {Gravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity.These waves are created by massive objects, like neutron stars or black holes, oscillating at speeds appreciable to the speed of light. The detectable effect on the Earth of these waves is extremely small, however, creating strains of the order of10{\textminus}21. There are a number of basic physics experiments around the world designed to detect these waves by using interferometers with very long arms, up to4 km in length. The next-generation interferometers are currently being designed, and the thermal noise in the mirrors will set the sensitivity over much of the usable bandwidth. Thermal noise arising from mechanical loss in the optical coatings put on the mirrors will be a significant source of noise. Achieving higher sensitivity through lower mechanical loss coatings, while preserving the crucial optical and thermal properties, is an area of active research right now.},

	Abstract = {Current interferometric gravitational wave detectors use test masses with mirror coatings formed from multiple layers of dielectric materials, most commonly alternating layers of SiO 2 (silica) and Ta 2 O 5 (tantala). However, mechanical loss in the Ta 2 O 5 /SiO 2 coatings may limit the design sensitivity for advanced detectors. We have investigated sources of mechanical loss in the Ta 2 O 5 /SiO 2 coatings, including loss associated with the coating--substrate interface, with the coating--layer interfaces and with the coating materials. Our results indicate that the loss is associated with the coating materials and that the loss of Ta 2 O 5 is substantially larger than that of SiO 2 .},

	Abstract = {We report on thermal noise from the internal friction of dielectric coatings made from alternating layers of Ta 2 O 5 and SiO 2 deposited on fused silica substrates. We present calculations of the thermal noise in gravitational wave interferometers due to optical coatings, when the material properties of the coating are different from those of the substrate and the mechanical loss angle in the coating is anisotropic. The loss angle in the coatings for strains parallel to the substrate surface was determined from ringdown experiments. We measured the mechanical quality factor of three fused silica samples with coatings deposited on them. The loss angle, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/phi.gif] {phi} || ( f ), of the coating material for strains parallel to the coated surface was found to be 4.2 $\pm$ 0.3 × 10 −4 for coatings deposited on commercially polished slides, and 1.0 $\pm$ 0.3 × 10 −4 for a coating deposited on a superpolished disc. Using these numbers, we estimate the effect of coatings on thermal noise in the initial LIGO and Advanced LIGO interferometers. We also find that the corresponding prediction for thermal noise in the 40 m LIGO prototype at Caltech is consistent with the noise data. These results are complemented by results for a different type of coating, presented in a companion paper.},

@article{Herriott:65,
	Abstract = {A long optical path has been folded between two 7.5-cm diam spherical or aspherical mirrors to provide an output beam which can be well separated from previous reflections with 1000 or more passes between the mirrors. The 3000-m path provides 10 {\textmu}sec of delay. This system can be used as a dispersionless optical delay line for use in filtering or storage of information modulated onto the light beam. The pattern of beams between the two mirrors is obtained in one of two ways. A small perturbing mirror may be inserted to give a series of offset ellipses, or one or both of the mirrors can be made astigmatic to give a Lissajous pattern of spots on each mirror. The output beam can be separated from others by discriminating in both angle and position. The diffraction losses of the system are much lower than those for an open beam because of the periodic focusing of the spherical mirrors. The extreme dependence of the loss of the delay line upon the absorption and scattering loss of the mirrors makes the system depeentupon very low loss mirrors and also makes the system a suitable method for measuring mirror loss.Block diagrams are shown for some possible filtering and storage applications.},

In the current pre-conceptual design, DECIGO will be comprising four interferometer units; each interferometer unit will be formed by three drag-free spacecraft with 1000 km separation. Since DECIGO will be an extremely challenging mission with high-precision formation flight with long baseline, it is important to increase the technical feasibility before its planned launch in 2027. Thus, we are planning to launch two milestone missions. DECIGO pathfinder (DPF) is the first milestone mission, and key components for DPF are being tested on ground and in orbit. In this paper, we review the conceptual design and current status of DECIGO and DPF.},

	Abstract = {Long-storage-time Fabry-Perot cavities are a core component of many precision measurementexperiments. Optical loss in such cavities is a critical parameter in determining their performance;however, it is very difficult to determine a priori from independent characterisation of theindividual cavity mirrors. Here, we summarise three techniques for directly measuring this loss insitu and apply them to a high-finesse, near-concentric, 2 m system. Through small modifications ofthe cavity\&\#x02019;s length, we explore optical loss as a function of beam spot size over the1\&\#x02013;3 mm range. In this regime we find that optical loss is relatively constant at around 5ppm per mirror and shows greater dependence on the positions of the beam spots on the cavity opticsthan on their size. These results have immediate consequences for the application of squeezed lightto advanced gravitational-wave interferometers.},

@article{Dwyer:13,
	Abstract = {Squeezed states of light are an important tool for optical measurements below the shot noise limit and for optical realizations of quantum information systems. Recently, squeezed vacuum states were deployed to enhance the shot noise limited performance of gravitational wave detectors. In most practical implementations of squeezing enhancement, relative fluctuations between the squeezed quadrature angle and the measured quadrature (sometimes called squeezing angle jitter or phase noise) are one limit to the noise reduction that can be achieved. We present calculations of several effects that lead to quadrature fluctuations, and use these estimates to account for the observed quadrature fluctuations in a LIGO gravitational wave detector. We discuss the implications of this work for quantum enhanced advanced detectors and even more sensitive third generation detectors.},
